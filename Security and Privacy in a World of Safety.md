Security and Privacy in a World of Safety
=====================================
Air Traffic Control
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Primary Surveillance Radar
    1. Ground based radar
    2. Measures the time difference between the signal transmission and reflection
    3. Independent Surveillance
2. Secondary Surveillance Radar
    1. Inspired by Indentify Friend and Foe(IFF) during WWII
    2. Transponder-based interrogation
    3. Mode A : identication code only
    4. Mode C : identification code and barometric altitude
    5. Mode S : selective addressing to interroate just one aircraft
    6. Dependent Surveillance
3. ATC today
    1. PSR + SSR + Synchronization
    2. the technology is old
        1. Enormous cost of operation, insufficient accuracy
    3. Changed to GPS
        1. higher accuracy
        2. cost-efficency
4. Problem
    1. No authentication
    2. No authorization
    3. No confidentiality
    4. No integrity
5. ADS-B
    1. Trusted GPS
6. Threats Model
    1. Passive Threats
        1. Receiving raw ADS-B data is easy
            1. Mode S : Pulse Position Modulation
            2. Software Defined Radio (GNU Radio)
        2. OpenSky
7. Crypto
8. Active Analysis
